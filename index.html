                    I've always leaned towards the small independent coffee shops rather than the larger chains, appreciating that some coffee is better than others, but never really understanding why. I've heard people talking about the various flavours they could taste in espresso, but I've always thought that "coffee just tasted like coffee". A small coffee shop in Australia opened my eyes a few years ago by serving the most amazing espresso I'd ever tasted. It was a single-origin and, for the first, it didn't just taste of coffee. It was fruity! 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I purchased a Sage/Breville Barista Express in September 2020, as a replacement for a Nespresso machine. The Nespresso machine is very convenient, but I wanted something better, especially as I primarily drink latte. My initial results with the Barista Express were good, but very inconsistent. This is a short guide to my experiences using the Barista Express, and how I achieve good consistent results with the single-wall (non-pressurised) double-shot basket.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This guide should also help to answer the typical question I see people asking too:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    I've just bought a Barista Express, my shots are too fast even though I'm at the finest grinder setting and/or have changed the internal burr ... what am I doing wrong?

                <h2>Initial experiences and inconsistent results</h2>
                <p>
                    By the time the machine arrived in the mail, I'd already watched a bunch of YouTube videos about dose, yield, grind size, timing, sour vs bitter, etc. I'd bought a bag of fresh, medium roasted, fruity, single-origin beans, and was ready to dial them in. I thought I was prepared, but I was wrong.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After filling the hopper with beans, I set the grind size somewhere in the middle ("8"), ground 18g of beans into the portafilter, levelled the coffee, tamped, and brewed a shot. The initial shots ran fast (<15 seconds), smelt sour, and definitely tasted sour. Plus the pressure gauge was only just inside the "espresso zone". I knew that "sour" meant under-extracted, and I wasn't getting enough pressure on the gauge, so I made the grind size finer, and tried again. Same result. Time to grind finer, and try again. Same result. I repeated this a few times, and eventually got down to a grind setting of "1", without any real change.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I did some research, and saw you could change the internal burr setting, to make the grind even finer. I switched this from "6" to "5", reset the outer grind setting to the middle again ("7"), and repeated the process until I managed to choke the machine. After this, I set the grind size one step coarser and left it at that. The resulting espresso was now pouring in the desired 25-35 second range, but still smelled and tasted sour. The tasting notes said, "tangy berries". I wasn't getting that, but I'd not tasted the coffee prepared using this bean, so I thought that was perhaps just how it was supposed to be. It wasn't unpleasant, and I did get some good lattes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'd read that light-medium roasted beans are harder to dial in, so I switched beans, with the next bag being a darker roast. These beans were a bit easier to dial in. The grind setting was coarser, the espresso flow looked more consistent, and I could definitely taste the chocolate flavour mentioned in the tasting notes. But the darker roast was a bit too much for me, so I went back to something medium roasted and fruity for the next bag. Dialling in beans was certainly getting easier, and I was now sometimes able to recognise some of the mentioned tasting notes. But everything was just so inconsistent. Some shots would gush, and some would choke. Some espressos would be rich with crema, with others being watery and thin. Some pours started out slow and steady, but then they'd switch to a gushing watery stream half way through. Trying to stop the yield at a specific weight was often hopeless. If I was aiming for a 36g yield, I'd try to stop the machine at 32g, to account for the drips that happen after shutting off the machine. Sometimes that would work, and sometimes I'd get 10-15g of liquid gush through the portafilter into the cup below (even after stopping the machine), completely missing my target.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I did some research on possible causes, which led me to "channeling", where the high pressure forces water through weak spots in the coffee puck. So I tried a few things to better distribute the coffee, including <a href="https://www.home-barista.com/weiss-distribution-technique.html" target="_blank">WDT</a>. This didn't help, which surprised me. I then decided to get a palm tamper/distribution tool, in a bid to improve the consistency. This didn't help either - initially anyway, but more on that later.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    At this point I was getting some great tasting coffee (especially with milk), but it was hugely inconsistent. Looking back, my resulting shots were very different to what that are now:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Then: espresso body was slightly watery; crema would be thin or not cover the entire shot, and dissipate quickly.</li>
                    <li>Now: body is much richer and darker; espresso pours like Guinness (a slow separation of liquid and crema into distinct layers), crema is thick and lasts much longer.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I knew that I was doing something wrong, but I couldn't figure out what it was. So I bought a bag of supermarket espresso blend beans (because they were cheaper) to experiment with. A dozen shots later (don't worry, I wasn't drinking it!), I'd managed to start pulling consistent smooth flowing shots. I'd finally stumbled upon what I was doing wrong - distribution and tamping.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So let's step back, what steps are required to get consistent espresso shots?

                    It's tempting to skip this step, especially early in the morning, but do wait at least 10-15 minutes to ensure everything is warmed up (including the portafilter, and basket). A warm machine does resolve some of the sourness and consistency problems. If you're in a hurry, push 2-3 single shots through an empty portafilter (no coffee; just the basket) to speed up the process.

                    The brewing temperature can also make a difference. A higher temperature can help tame sourness, and a lower temperature can help tame bitterness. Whenever I get a new bean, I will adjust the brewing temperature as follows:
                </p>
                
                <ul>

                     <li>Medium roast: +0C (default)</li>
                     <li>Medium-dark roast: -1/-2C</li>
                </ul>

                    If in doubt, use the default temperature and only adjust the temperature if you're having issues with a sourness or bitterness that remains after what looks a perfect shot.

                <p>
                    I initially started with the single-wall single-shot basket because I thought I'd use fewer beans this way, but it turns out the single-shot basket is notoriously difficult to work with. So I switched it out for the single-wall double-shot basket.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Every coffee is different, but I find that 18g (+/- 1g) is a good starting point for the Barista Express, in the standard single-wall double-shot basket. Whatever dose you choose, be consistent, and be precise. +/-0.5g dose difference between shots can and does make a difference. If you choose a dose of 17.5g, weigh this out every time. It's tedious, but essential for consistency.

                <h2>Accurate scales</h2>
                <p>
                    For consistency, you'll definitely need some scales with an accuracy to 0.1 of a gram.
                    I was initially using some cheap kitchen/jewellery scales and they worked really well until they stopped working one morning.
                    I suspect water/espresso got into the electronics. 😢
                </p>

                <p>
                    While waiting for some new scales to arrive, I used my regular kitchen scales, which are only accurate to 1g.
                    The resulting shots were all over the place, and getting any sort of consistency was nigh on impossible.
                    I didn't even get good results with a bean I've had before, with shots running fast and channeling.
                    As I later discovered, these scales, although accurate to 1g, were also off calibration by 1g.
                    So "18g" of measured beans was really only in the region of 17g.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, I actually got more consistent results from dosing out beans into an egg cup, so that's something to try if your scales ever stop working.
                    Rather than buying cheaper scales again, and ultimately replacing them when they fail in a few weeks, I decided to buy the <a href="https://acaia.co/products/acaia_lunar" target="_blank">Acaia Lunar</a>.
                    They're expensive, but built to last, and the auto-tare/auto-start feature is fantastic.

                    Every coffee is different, and every Barista Express is different, so it's impossible to say "use grind size X for bean Y".
                    Because I'd not made espresso at home before, it occurred to me that I didn't actually know what the ground coffee should look like.
                    "A little finer than table salt" is what you'll read online, so I ground some beans at varying sizes and pulled some shots.
                    The first image below is a photo of the grind size that worked (for that bean), and with some table salt scattered on top for comparison.
                    The other photos show a different ground coffee, which resulted in a 1:2 ratio in ~30 seconds.

                <p>
                    I appreciate that each bean requires a different grind size, but this is coarser than I thought. Once I saw this, I realised I'd been grinding too fine with those early bags of beans, and I reset my inner burr back to "6" as a result. The probability of channeling increases with finer grind sizes too, and I definitely saw this early on with shots that would gush after a few seconds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The grinder on the Barista Express has discrete steps, each represented by a number on the outside dial. These steps can sometimes (not always) result in a large change in extraction time (+/- >5 seconds). For this reason, if you find that, for example, a shot at grind setting "5" is running too fast, and grind setting "4" is too slow, you could try:
                </p>
                    
                <ul>
                    <li>A grind setting of "5" with 0.5-1g more coffee (increasing dose will slow the shot down, because it provides more resistance).</li>
                    <li>A grind setting of "4" with 0.5-1g less coffee (decreasing the dose will speed the shot up, because it provides less resistance).</li>

                <p>
                    You may find this affects the taste slightly (because you're changing the extraction), but it's worth trying if you're stuck between grinder settings.

                <h2>Single dosing vs filling the hopper</h2>
                <p>
                    I've tried both, and now single dose. Filling the hopper with beans is convenient, but:
                </p>

                <ul>
                     <li>the dose control ("Grind Amount") dial is time-based, which leads to inconsistent doses (in terms of coffee weight)</li>
                     <li>the fineness of the grind changes depending on how full/empty the grinder is (I dialled in a bean with a full hopper, and needed to change the grind size as the hopper emptied ... ageing will also have contributed to these changes)</li>
                     <li>although the hopper is "air tight", it still contains air, which will allow the beans to age more quickly than if you keep them in an air tight container (with the air pushed out), or in a vacuum</li>
                </ul>    

                <p>
                    Single dosing is less convenient, but:
                </p>
                    
                <ul>
                    <li>it results in less waste of beans (my day-to-day coffee waste is zero)</li>
                    <li>you get a more consistent dose (you can weigh the beans in, and weigh the grounds out)</li>
                    <li>you get a more consistent grind size from shot to shot</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    To single dose, set the "Grind Amount" dial to maximum, and the "Filter Size" to "Double". Put your weighed dose of beans into the grinder, and press the button underneath the grinder (where you'd usually put the portafilter), with your cup underneath. You don't need to hold this button in. The grinder sound will change to a high pitched noise when it's empty, and you can stop the grinder by pressing the "Filter Size" button.

                <h2>Grinder retention</h2>
                <p>
                    The grinder on the Barista Express does not have zero-retention. In other words, there is always some ground coffee in the grinder. If you take out the inner burr, you'll see this. I've not measured it, but I suspect there's a few grams of ground coffee in the gaps between the top and bottom of the grinder. For this reason, especially when you're dialling in a new bean, you'll need to purge a few grams each time you change the grinder setting, to discard the coffee ground at the previous setting. The same is true when you switch beans. In other words, grind 5-10g of beans, and throw away the grounds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After dialling in a bean, during daily use, if I put 17.5g of beans into the grinder, I typically get 17.5g of ground coffee out ... +/- 0.2g. During the grinding process, you're pushing out some of the ground coffee stuck in the grinder, and replacing it with fresh coffee. In other words, out of that 17.5g of fresh beans, you might be getting 15g of freshly ground coffee, plus 2.5g of coffee from the previous grind, with 2.5g of freshly ground coffee now being stuck in the gaps. I use my machine every day, and don't notice any effect on taste of this, so I wouldn't worry about it too much. This might be different if you only use your machine once a week though. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Occasionally I'll get more coffee out of the grinder than expected, and sometimes less. It's easy to fix this by removing some grounds, or by grinding a few more beans into the cup. If you want consistent shots, I definitely recommend weighing the beans in, and the ground coffee out.

                <p>

                <p>
                    The built-in grinder doesn't always give you fluffy ground coffee, so needs a little help. I initially ground straight into the portafilter, but that limits the options you have for fluffing up the ground coffee unless you have a dosing ring or funnel.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Certainly on the finer grind settings, you might notice some clumps in the ground coffee. If you've ground into a cup, just give it a shake to break the clumps up. Don't shake the cup in circles though, as you'll probably see the clumps getting bigger as they roll around the surface. Alternatively, use the WDT technique to de-clump the coffee grounds.
                </p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    A quick note: When I started using a cup to grind into, I would give the cup a gentle shake to fluff up the grounds, and often the shots would choke. My initial thoughts were, "oh, shaking the cup causes the shot to choke, so I should shake it more gently". Actually, I was interpreting the results in the wrong way - shaking the cup was eliminating the clumps and air pockets that form when grinding at finer settings, and now the machine was choking on the more consistent grounds, rather than channeling from finding weak paths through the clumpier grounds. Grinding into a cup was what transformed my espresso experience for the better.

                    I initially used a small cup (left) that I found in the local kitchen store.
                    The diameter of the cup almost matches the portafilter, so I could place the portafilter upside-down on the cup, and flip both over in a single movement, to transfer the ground coffee to the portafilter.
                    Although it worked, I'd sometimes lose ground coffee out of the sides because the cup wasn't a perfect fit.
                    I now use the <a href="https://www.cremacoffeepro.com/collections/tools-for-breville/products/54mm-dosing-cup" target="_blank">Crema Coffee Products 54mm dosing cup</a> (right), which has been specifically designed for the Barista Express.

                <h2>Tamping pressure (and the Razor tool)</h2>
                <p>
                    You'll read a variety of thoughts on tamping; either that you need 30lbs/15kgs of pressure, or that tamping pressure doesn't matter so much provided you are consistent between shots. Having never made espresso before, I had no idea how much pressure to apply. Occasionally I'd get a good shot, but most would either run too slow or too fast.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So I decided to get a palm tamper, specifically the <a href="https://www.cremacoffeepro.com/collections/all-products/products/53mm-tamper-distributor-combo" target="_blank">53mm Tamper & Distributor Combo</a> from Crema Coffee Products.
                    Palm tampers can be set to a specific depth, allowing you to consistently tamp to that same depth every time.
                    Does this provide the suggested 30lbs/15kgs of pressure?
                    No, a palm tamper/distribution tool will not provide a constant pressure of 30lbs/15kgs, but it will provide a consistent pressure because of the consistent depth, and therefore consistent compression of the ground coffee ... when you're grinding the same beans, at the same setting, with the same dose.
                    For this reason, I use a regular tamper for dialling in, and the palm tamper for consistent results afterwards. But how deep do you set the palm tamper?
                </p>                

                <p>
                    I followed the advice on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZBbDMYPDGI" target="_blank">How to Set Palm Tamper Depth | Breville Barista Express - Lifestyle Lab</a> which basically sets the tamper to the same depth as the Razor tool that ships with the Barista Express. This didn't work at all for me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/how-hard-should-you-tamp/" target="_blank">How Hard Should You Tamp?</a> is a great article on tamping, and it made me realise that although you can't "tamp too hard", there is a minimum tamp that you need to compress the ground coffee.
                    With some beans and doses, tamping to the level suggested by the Razor tool isn't enough.
                    The Razor tool depth is really the maximum level of coffee in the basket.
                    The thing that really fixed my lack of consistency and channeling was tamping harder - I wasn't compressing the coffee enough, and the shots were channelling, which ultimately led to the sourness.
                    A good starting point is to just tamp *hard*, and don't be tempted to use tamping pressure to influence the extraction time (at least initially, when you're getting started).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Back to the tamper/distributor combo tool. When dialling in a new bean, I will keep the distribution side at the minimum level, and use this to distribute the grounds in the basket.
                    I then still need to tamp to compress the coffee, because the distribution tool provides very little compression on the minimum setting (it's just levelling the surface). I will still use a regular tamper at this point.
                </p>

                <p>            
                    Once you have a bean dialled in, there are a couple of ways in which you can use a distributor/tamper tool. Prepare a tamped puck as above, and:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Option 1: Keep the distribution side at the minimum setting, and set the depth of the palm tamper to that tamped puck. With future pucks, you distribute first, then use the palm tamper to tamp at that consistent depth.</li>
                    <li>Option 2: Set the distribution side to the depth of a tamped puck. With future pucks, you can use the distribution tool to provide distribution and compression (i.e. you don't need to tamp).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    I initially used option 1, with the distribution side (on the minimum setting) to smooth out/level the ground coffee, and then tamped to compress the coffee. I think the distribution tool helps push the coffee grounds towards the edge of the basket, resulting in a better seal than just tamping. It also provides a much easier (and flat) starting point for tamping. This distribution/tamping combination hugely improved shot flow/timing/taste consistency.
                </p>

                <p>            
                    I then tried option 2, just using the distributor side of the tool (inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z5vTi643sc" target="_blank">How To: The Jack Espresso Leveler Setup and Use</a>, and this gives great results too, with one less step.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Of course, if you change the grind size or dose, you may need to adjust the depth of your distribution tool/palm tamper. Also bear in mind that a distribution tool/palm tamper has a maximum depth that it can be set to, and that maximum depth might not provide enough compression for smaller doses, especially at finer grind settings. On a related note, there's also a limit to how far you can insert any tamper or distribution tool into the basket given the slight curvature of the basket wall, so make sure you don't under fill your basket.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The distribution tool doesn't eliminate channeling altogether (so you might need to tap/level the grounds or do WDT beforehand), but when I do see channeling now, there tends to be an obvious tiny hole on the surface of the puck, rather than any visible gaps around the edges.

                <h2>Measuring time - button press or first drop of espresso?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Barista Express has a 7-10 second pre-infusion phase, which wets the coffee puck before full pressure kicks in.
                    Some people start timing their shots from pressing the button, others from when the first drops of espresso hit the cup.
                    This raises the question of whether shot timings should include or exclude pre-infusion.
                    From what I can tell, there's no "correct" answer.
                    I would just choose one option and stick with it, trying different timings to see what tastes best.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I start the timer from when I press the button, because it's easier and includes the total time in which water and coffee are in contact.
                    I hit the tasting notes with shots in the 25-35 second range (from button press).

                <p>

                    This does, of course, mean that you will need to weigh your shot while it's pouring, by placing your cup on some scales.
                    If you're aiming for 40g, you'll need to press the button to stop the shot when your scales indicate ~37g, to allow for the remaining drips after the pump stops.

                <p>
                    A quick note about the pressure gauge. Having watched many videos on YouTube, I don't think the pressure gauge is very consistent between machines. All of my best shots are made with the pressure gauge at the very top end, and even over, the grey "espresso range". The pressure gauge is useful as a general guide, but I don't really pay much attention to it any more. Watching the flow and timing of the shot is much more important.

                <p>
                    If the shot is too fast:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Make the grind size finer.</li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    But ... if you're new to espresso, it's very possible that the grind size is too fine, which is causing channeling, and an overall fast extraction time.
                    In this case, making the grind size even finer will exaggerate the problem and, counterintuitively, the solution is to make the grind coaser.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's worth carefully watching your shot before setting the grind size finer.
                    If the shot starts out well (a slow smooth flow), and then gushes to finish fast, the shot might be running fast overall (from a timing perspective) because the puck is channeling.
                    A grind that is too fine and not tamped properly will also cause channeling - the coffee initially creates a lot of resistance and you might not see any flow for a while, but then the high pressure water breaks through the weak spots. 
                    I had this problem a lot at first.
                    Another sign of grinding too fine is high pressure during the initial pre-infusion, or the pressure gauge hitting the end of the scale.

                    I start with a 1:2 ratio (e.g. 18g in, 36g out) and adjust from there.
                    With lighter roasts, I often find a slightly higher ratio helps bring out some of the fruity flavours (e.g. 18g in, 40g out).

                <h2>Minimising waste</h2>
                <p>
                    This might be an unpopular opinion but ... when you're starting out, you're going to waste a lot of beans getting to know the machine, and also when dialling in new beans.
                    I generally drink latte, and although I'll try to chase the tasting notes of a particular bean, I'm not necessarily seeking espresso perfection.
                    Unless the shot is really fast and gushes out (<15 seconds), or really slow and barely drips out (>45 seconds), I'll usually drink it as a latte.
                        Once mixed with steamed milk, any sour or bitter flavours aren't really noticeable.
                        I will make a note to change the grind setting next time I make a shot though.
                        Having said that, I will usually have a quick taste of the espresso, to get a feel how/whether it can be improved next time.
                        But my goal is to also minimise wastage.

                <h2>Storing beans</h2>
                <p>
                    I originally used a large airtight mason jar for storing beans, and that did work when the jar was kept relatively full.
                    The beans did age quickly once I had a large amount of air in there though.
                    I bought two 250g bags of the same beans, opened the first and stored it in the mason jar, with the beans only filling about one third of the jar's capacity.
                    On day one, the espresso shots were fantastic, with lots of crema and identifiable fruity tasting notes.
                    On day two, everything changed. I had to grind two steps finer to slow the shots down, and the resulting shots had much less crema and flavour.
                    Sufficient for milk-based drinks, but definitely not the same.
                    Once those beans were finished, I opened the second bag, reset the grinder to the original coarser setting, and everything was good once again.
                    I stored these new beans in a resealable bag, with the air pushed out.
                    Shots for the rest of the bag were consistently good, with no grind size changes required.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All of this made me realise that having an airtight jar is meaningless if there's more air than beans.
                    I now use an <a href="https://planetarydesign.com/shop/airscape-kitchen-canisters/" target="_blank">Airscape canister</a> to store my beans.
                    It's a total game changer for increased shot consistency.

                </ul>
            
                <p>
                    The steam wand on the Barista Express has less power than many other machines, which I think is a good thing, because it gives you enough time to think about and see what's happening. With "whole milk" straight from the fridge, the basic steps are:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Point the steam wand over the drip tray (no jug), and turn it on.</li>
                    <li>Wait until you hear the pump kick in, and a consistent steam of stream is produced (typically 10-15 seconds).</li>
                    <li>Turn off the steam wand, and insert it into the jug, with the wand tip underneath the surface of the milk.</li>
                    <li>Turn the steam wand back on, and steam your milk as they show in the tutorials. 🙂</li>
                    <li>Clean and purge the wand before starting your latte art pour.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I usually introduce air until I can feel the milk jug is just starting to become just ever so slightly warmer than my hand, perhaps just before that, (10-20 seconds, depending on jug size), and then quickly switch to incorporating the air by creating a vortex until the jug is too hot to touch for more than a couple of seconds.
                    If your jug has a thermometer sticker, use that and aim for 60-65C.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The result you're aiming for is a glossy/shiny micro-foam, where you can't see visible bubbles on the surface of the milk. From the initial positioning of the wand tip underneath the milk, small vertical changes of the wand into the milk are all you need (you'll see this in the tutorials), and I aim to keep the process as quiet/controlled as possible. 
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    I was initially adding too much air, and over-stretching the milk - and you might also find that you don't need as much air as you think you do too. Knowing when to stop adding air is the hardest part of steaming milk. As I said above, I usually stop adding air when the temperature of the jug is about the same temperature as my hand. If you can avoid adding large bubbles early on in the process, you can actually see a subtle visible change to the surface of the milk, and the way it moves. Initially the milk will spin around the jug like a liquid quite freely. As you introduce air though, this changes and the surface becomes thicker with larger "waves".
                    The sound changes too; the "chirping" sound initially gets longer before becoming intermittent as the milk volume increases and covers the steam wand tip.
                    It's very subtle, and you won't notice it as first, but that's my key to stop adding air.
                    I do find that I need to add slightly more air for lighter roasts (thinner body with less crema), and less air for darker roasts (thicker body with more crema).

                    I'm no expert in pouring latte art, and don't really have any tips, so I'll leave that to the tutorials.
                    It doesn't take long to learn the basics though, and you'll see improvement through regular practice.
                    Here's a snapshot of my latte art during the first 2 months.

                <h3>Choosing your milk jug</h3>
                <p>
                    My Barista Express came with a milk jug, which I've had great results with, and it's a perfect size for steaming milk for a 12oz latte.
                    It's a little large for steaming enough milk for an 8oz latte though, because the steam wand doesn't quite reach far enough into the jug when you use less milk.
                    So I decided to buy a smaller jug. I didn't want anything fancy, just something smaller, which I picked up from a local coffee shop. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    While I was happy with the size, I really struggled to get any half-decent looking latte art with the new smaller jug, and I couldn’t work out what I was doing wrong.
                    After much frustration, and after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq-il7LULCo" target="_blank">Milk Pitchers Explained - Seattle Coffee Gear</a> in desperation, it turns out that the smaller jug has a couple of issues.
                    First of all (not shown in the photos below), the handle isn’t quite mounted perfectly vertically, so you’re always pouring at a slight angle.
                    Secondly, and more importantly, the spout isn’t straight, so the milk tends to flow more to one side! 🙄
                    I guess that's what you get from buying a cheap unbranded product.
                </p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    So I picked up another (this time, branded) milk jug and immediately had better results.
                    In this case, the tools were definitely to blame!

                <h2>Hot chocolate</h2>
                <p>                
                    I wanted to figure out how to make hot chocolate with my Barista Express, mostly as an excuse to practice latte art, but it's also great for those cold winter nights.
                    It's surprisingly easy, and I've successfully made delicious hot chocolate with instant hot chocolate, and <a href="https://www.hotelchocolat.com/uk/classic-drinking-chocolate.html" target="_blank">Hotel Chocolat's Classic Hot Chocolate</a>.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Ignore any instructions on the packet. 🙂</li>
                    <li>Make up an espresso sized, super-concentrated hot chocolate. I typically use 3 teaspoons of instant power/chocolate flakes with 30-40ml of hot water (either from the Barista Express hot water spout, or via your kettle).</li>
                    <li>Stir until smooth, and add a little water to thin out the mixture if it's too thick/gloopy.</li>
                    <li>Measure our your usual volume of milk, and steam/pour as usual.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    You can adjust the initial espresso sized hot chocolate as needed for taste, with more or less powder/chocolate flakes
                    Making an espresso sized hot chocolate base means that you can stick to your usual recipes.
                    For example, I make a 230ml/8oz latte from 30ml/1oz espresso (double shot) plus 170ml/6oz of pre-steamed milk. I can follow the same quantities for hot chocolate, and the result is delicious. If the hot chocolate separates after sitting for a while, give it a quick swirl to mix everything back together again.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The consistency of hot chocolate is slightly thicker than espresso, which does make pouring latte art a bit harder.
                    It's a great way to practice though (both steaming milk, and pouring latte art), without the caffeine intake.
                    I even do cortado size portions for my kids.
